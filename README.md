It is a Weather fetching website. Technologies used in my project are -

• Data fetching from the OpenWeathermapAPi • All the weather details with values • Config Driven UI • weather fetching for whole world

I've built this complete website using React JS, Redux - Toolkit, JavaScript, Tailwind, HTML & CSS.

Note - This website is responsive. So you can watch it through smartphone as well as from PC.
